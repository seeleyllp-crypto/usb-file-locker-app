# USB File Locker App

USB File Locker App is a Windows desktop toolkit for locking files and folders with a USB key, keeping a personal vault, reviewing privacy-safe audit logs, and watching for suspicious access patterns.

## Main desktop apps

- `usb_file_locker.py` - main locker window
- `privacy_safety_hub.py` - dashboard and safety controls
- `personal_vault_pad.py` - simpler personal vault window
- `audit_log_viewer.py` - signed audit trail viewer
- `global_breach_guard.py` - topmost watcher for repeated risky events
- `text_log_processor.py` - cleans up pasted text-style logs
- `locked_file_browser.py` - finds locked files fast
- `perm_unlock_workbench.py` - edit and relock workflow
- `key_inspector.py` - inspects owner and USB key setup
- `quick_lock_note.py` - makes locked notes quickly

## API folder

The public Railway-ready API lives in:

- `usb_locker_api/`

That folder is also safe to copy into its own separate repo if you want a standalone API project.

## Repo safety notes

This repo intentionally leaves out machine-bound or private runtime data such as:

- local audit logs
- DPAPI-bound audit keys
- active settings files
- temporary files
- generated build output
- packaged installer folders

Use `settings.example.json` as the template for fresh installs or for documenting config shape.

## Good files to share

- `.py` source files
- `.bat` launchers
- `README.txt`
- `README.md`
- installer source files like `.spec` and `EasyLockerSetup.cs`
- `usb_locker_api/`

## Before pushing to GitHub

1. Double-check that no live keys, vault files, or logs were moved into the folder manually.
2. Make sure `settings.json` stays ignored and only `settings.example.json` is shared.
3. Review staged files before each commit.
4. Push the full app repo and the standalone API repo separately if you want cleaner project pages.
